# 05-week: Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

# Description / Motivation

This was a project to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Using the daily planner, a user can create a detailed schedule to maintain a sense of ogranization and mental clarity. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, and time blocks for standard business hours are displayed when the user scrolls down. When a user views time blocks for a certain day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
